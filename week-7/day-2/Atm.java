/*Assignment 6: Custom Exception in Banking Application Build a simple banking application in Java. Create a custom checked exception named InsufficientFundsException, which will be thrown when a user tries to withdraw an amount that exceeds their account balance. Implement classes for bank accounts, and provide methods for depositing and withdrawing money. Throw the InsufficientFundsException when a withdrawal amount is greater than the available balance. Handle this exception in an appropriate way and display a user-friendly error message.*/
